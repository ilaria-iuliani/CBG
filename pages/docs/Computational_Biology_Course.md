# Computational Biology Course

This course is designed for third-year B.Sc. students and is part of the "Genetics and Genome Evolution" (GGE) module.

## Course Aims:
- **Get to know some key bioinformatics methods** necessary for genomic analysis.
- **Apply these methods,** focusing on data-visualisation (typically trying to reproduce selected figures discussed in other GGE courses).
- **Develop an understanding of potential pitfalls** and the impact of bioinformatics choices in genomic results.

## Prerequisites:
- Notions of genomics (gene, genome, transcriptome).
- Basic statistics (understanding tests, p-values).
- Basic literacy in R and/or Python.

## Instructors:
- [Sven Bergmann](link-to-sven-profile)

## Assistants:
- [Olga](link-to-olga-profile)
- [Michael](link-to-michael-profile)
- [Anneke](link-to-anneke-profile)
- [Daniel](link-to-daniel-profile)
- [Sofia](link-to-sofia-profile)
- [Ilaria](link-to-ilaria-profile)

We will hand out one exercise for each tutorial. Students will start working on these exercises in the tutorial session and will need to submit their answers within one week. The submissions will be graded and count towards the final grade for this course.
