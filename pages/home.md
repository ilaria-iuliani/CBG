Welcome to the Statistical Physics of Cells and Genomes Lab. Research in our group focuses on the development of theoretical models grounded on data and advanced model-guided data analysis to describe a broad range of biological phenomena. Our current main research topics include the physiology of cell growth and cell-cycle progression, chromosome organization inside the cell, the evolution of chromosomes including the emergence of aneuploidy, quantification of different mutation processes and phenotypic switches.
